# *PyQuiver*

*A user-friendly program for calculating isotope effects.*

*PyQuiver* is an open-source Python program for calculating kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) and equilibrium isotope effects (EIEs) using harmonic frequencies and the Bigeleisen-Mayer equation.  *PyQuiver* requires Cartesian Hessian matrices, which can be calculated using any electronic structure program.  

### Features

* automatically read frequencies from [`Gaussian`](http://www.gaussian.com/g_prod/g09.htm) and [`ORCA`](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal) output files
* excellent performance for larger systems
* custom isotopic substitutions and arbitrary temperature
* tunnelling corrections: Wigner and Bell inverted parabola
* run via command line or simple Python API

### Installation

*PyQuiver* requires Python 3 and [`numpy`](https://numpy.org).  No other libraries are necessary.

1. Install [Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) if necesary.  The standard Anaconda distribution will contain the necessary dependencies.
2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  git comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions and Macs.
3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ekwan/PyQuiver.git`.  (If you don't want to deal with `git`, click on the green "clone or download" button on this github repository page and click on "Download ZIP" to receive an archive.)

*PyQuiver* has been tested on PC, Mac, and Linux platforms.
